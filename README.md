# Disappearin gNotes

Changes how the Ghost Notes modifier works. This is primarily meant to make Ghost Notes more easily viewable on the Desktop but can also be enabled in VR (Disables Score Submission).

Instead of only showing the blocks arrow, this will show and fade out the entire note. The distance at which the note becomes hidden, and over which the note fades out can be customized.

**This does not work when you use Custom Notes**
